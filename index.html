									<h2><a href="#"> Civilian Labor Force, Employment and Unemployment Rate </a></h2>
									
								</header>

								
								<p>
									The Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) program is a federal-state cooperative effort in 
									which monthly estimates of total employment and unemployment are prepared for over 7,500 
									geographic and statistical areas. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics <a href="https://www.bls.gov/lau/lauov.htm">website</a>, 
									"The concepts and definitions underlying LAUS data come from the Current Population Survey (CPS), 
									the household survey that is the source of the national unemployment rate. State monthly model-based 
									estimates are controlled in "real time" to sum to national monthly employment and unemployment estimates 
									from the CPS. These models combine current and historical data from the CPS, the Current Employment 
									Statistics (CES) survey, and state unemployment insurance (UI) systems." 
								</p>
								
								<p>
									<a href="https://eller.arizona.edu/departments-research/centers-labs/economic-business-research">The Economic Business Research Center (ERBC) at The University of Arizona Eller College of Management</a>
									adjusts the data provided by the LAUS program for seasonal effects such as holiday related employment changes.
									
								</p>

								<p> The civilian labor force, or just labor force, includes all people age 16 and older 
									who are classified as either employed or unemployed. These are people that are either
									working or actively looking for work. Those that are active duty military personnel or institutionalized
									are not included in the civilian labor force <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cps/definitions.htm">(BLS definitions)</a>. </p>

								<p> The unemployment rate is the ratio of the unemployed population to the labor force. 
									During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020 the unemployment 
									rate in Pinal County jumped to nearly 13%  
									<a href="https://www.azeconomy.org/unemployment-rate-sa-western-states-and-u-s/">(Arizona 13.9%, US 14.7%)</a>. </p>

									<h2><a href="#">Wages and Employment<br />
									by Industry</a></h2>
									
								</header>

								<p>Pinal County, Arizona private sector average weekly wages and average monthly employment 
									levels during the fourth quarter of 2021. Data are from the
									<a href="https://www.bls.gov/cew/">Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) program</a>.
									QCEW provides the 
									most detailed private sector employment and wage estimates by industry for the U.S., 
									all states, metro areas, and counties. </p>
								<p>QCEW monthly employment data represent the number of covered workers who worked during, 
									or received pay for, the pay period that included the 12th day of the month. 
									Covered employees in the private-sector and in the state and local government 
									include most corporate officials, all executives, all supervisory personnel, 
									all professionals, all clerical workers, many farmworkers, all wage earners, 
									all piece workers, and all part-time workers. Workers on paid sick leave, paid holiday, 
									paid vacation, and the like are also covered. 
									<!--Federal employment data are based on reports of monthly employment and reports of 
										quarterly wages, both submitted quarterly to state agencies. Reports are submitted 
										for all federal installations with employees covered by the act, except for certain 
										national security agencies, which are excluded for security reasons.--></p>										
								<p>QCEW wages data represent the total compensation paid during the calendar quarter, 
									regardless of when the services were performed. Covered employer contributions 
									to old-age, survivors, and disability insurance, health insurance, UI, workers' 
									compensation and private pension and welfare funds are not reported as wages. 
									Employee contributions for the same purposes, however, as well as money withheld 
									for income taxes, union dues, and so forth, are reported, even though they are 
									deducted from the worker’s gross pay <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cew/overview.htm">(CEW overview)</a>.</p>
